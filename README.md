# NaturalKillerCells_PDAC

Processed data and downstream analysis of IMC and scRNAseq data for the paper: Natural killer cells associate with malignant epithelial cells in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor microenvironment. 
This repository includes the R script that will generate Figures 1B-D, 1F, 2CD, 2F, 3G-L, and 4A-G, and Supplementary Figures S1-2, S7-8. The R script will also provide the code to get the values to input into external software (e.g., Excel and GraphPad Prism) to generate Figures 2E, 3A-C, Supplementary Figure S3-6.
IMC data to be loaded into the Global Environment can be found at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.10582038
scRNAseq data was previously published at doi: 10.1038/s43018-020-00121-4.
